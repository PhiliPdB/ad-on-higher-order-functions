# Automatic Differentiation on Higher Order Functions

This project is done under supervision by Matthijs V치k치r for the course "Concepts of Programming Language Design" at Utrecht University.
For this project we implemented a Automatic Differentiation algorithm created by Matthijs V치k치r [[1]](https://arxiv.org/abs/2007.05283), which can perform Automatic Differentiation on Higher-Order Functions.

## Example programs
A few example programs are available in [Examples.hs](./Examples.hs). These can be tested by first building the library (`stack build`) and then opening the file in GHCi (`stack ghci Examples.hs`).
