# Automatic Differentiation on Higher Order Functions

This project is done under supervision by Matthijs V치k치r for the course "Concepts of Programming Language Design" at Utrecht University.
For this project we implemented a Automatic Differentiation algorithm created by Matthijs V치k치r [[1]], which can perform Automatic Differentiation on Higher-Order Functions.
